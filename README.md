# C64DS V0.1.0

<img align="right" width="220" src="./logo.png" />

This is a Commodore 64 (PAL) emulator for the Nintendo DS.

Too much stuff is still missing for it to be more than a novelty.
* Graphics is poorly emulated.
* Sound is missing ring, sync & filter emulation.
* Timer emulation is not cycle accurate, missing TA to TB chaining.
* Cpu is missing a lot of the finer cycle rules.
* There is no disc drive or tape emulation yet, just fake loading of ".prg" files.

## How to use

1. Create a folder named "c64ds" in either the root of your flash card or in
 the data folder. This is where settings and save files end up.
2. Now put .prg files into a folder where you have (C64) files.
3. Depending on your flashcart you might have to DLDI patch the emulator.

When the emulator starts, you can either press L+R or tap on the screen to open
up the menu. Now you can use the cross or touchscreen to navigate the menus, A
or double tap to select an option, B or the top of the screen to go back a step.

To select between the tabs use R & L or the touchscreen.

### About

Some info about the emulator and game...

## Controls

There is no convention on C64 which port is player 1 and which is player 2, so
you will have to switch port a lot. Fire is right now mapped to the B button.

## Games

* Bubble Bobble actually seem to work.
* Great Giana Sisters is missing sprite collision.
